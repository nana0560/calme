Requirements
Functional Requirements

Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Scientific functions (square root, power, trigonometric functions, logarithms)
Memory functions (store, recall, clear)
History of calculations
Support for parentheses and order of operations
Percentage calculations

Non-functional Requirements

Response time under 100ms for all operations
Support for both portrait and landscape orientations
Accessibility features for users with disabilities
Offline functionality
Low battery consumption

Target Platforms

iOS (iOS 14.0+)
Android (Android 8.0+)

Architecture
Overview
The app will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

Model: Handles calculation logic and data management
View: Manages the UI components
Controller: Coordinates between Model and View

Components

Calculation Engine:

Expression parser
Mathematical operations library
Precision handling


User Interface Layer:

Button grid
Display area
History panel


Data Management:

Calculation history storage
Settings persistence



User Interface
Main Screen

Display area (shows input and results)
Numeric keypad (0-9)
Basic operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷)
Function buttons (depending on mode)
Memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC)
Additional controls (settings, history, etc.)

UI States

Basic Mode: Shows essential arithmetic controls
Scientific Mode: Expands to show scientific functions
History View: Displays previous calculations

Design Guidelines

Use high contrast colors for button visibility
Ensure minimum touch target size of 48×48dp
Maintain consistent spacing between buttons
Provide haptic feedback for button presses
Use system font for compatibility

Core Functionality
Expression Handling

Infix notation for input
Convert to postfix notation for evaluation
Support for nested parentheses
Operator precedence handling

Calculation Logic

Implement standard arithmetic operations
Handle division by zero and other edge cases
Maintain precision for decimal operations
Support for scientific notation

Memory Management

Store up to 5 values in memory
Support addition/subtraction to/from memory
Clear memory functionality

Error Handling

Display meaningful error messages
Recover gracefully from invalid inputs
Provide hints for resolution
